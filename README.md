# Minesweeper
A simple react app I made to play with using SVG graphics from react code.

## Usage
`npm install`, then `npm start`
Use left mouse button to reveal tiles, right mouse button to mark mines.

## Functionality still missing to be on par with basic minesweeper:
- Ensuring first clicked tile is actually safe
- Automatically revealing tiles next to revealed "0"
- Ability to reveal all neighbouring tiles of a revealed tile when number on the tile matches number of mines marked around it
- Button to restart the board (currently refreshing the page is the only way)
- Timer
- Score table
- Different board sizes
